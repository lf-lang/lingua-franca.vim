# Lingua Franca Plugin for Vim

This Vim plugin provides basic support for Lingua Franca files.
It brings basic syntax highlighting and rudimentary text-object support for the target code blocks.

## Installation

The best and easiest solution for installing the Plugin is one of the available Plugin managers for Vim.
If you're using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), simply add the following:
```Vim
Plug 'lf-lang/lingua-franca.vim'
```

Alternatively, you can install the plugin manually by copying the three directories (ftplugin, ftdetect, syntax) and their contents into:

- `~/.vim/` if you're using Vim
- `~/.config/nvim/` if you're using Neovim
- Or really anywhere in your Vim 'runtimepath'
